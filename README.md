## My Wild Adventure
This is a text-based RPG game where you click on buttons to decide where to go.

There is a fighting system in place where you can fight monsters.

This game was made following Ryisnow's Youtube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5yr4sekAI0). His guide is extremely helpful.

I did not change UI much. However, I did change the public variables to private, as well as change the story around and add some of my own methods.

## How to Play

You will have to download [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) beforehand to run the game

Open the `WildAdventure.bat` file to play the game
